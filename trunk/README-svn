You'll need automake 1.9 or later and autoconf 2.59 or later installed to
generate the configure script and Makefile.in.  If you have both tools
installed, executing `autoconf -i -s' will create the configure script,
the Makefile.in, and install some missing files.  The byte-code version
of the maude mode will be generated by executing the configure script
produced by the step above.

For development, it is unecessary to build the byte-code version of the
editing mode, emacs should interprete the source file directly.
